# Java ArithmeticException: Integer Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common Java error: an `ArithmeticException` caused by division by zero.  The `bug.java` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.java` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises from a lack of error handling. The program attempts to divide an integer by zero without checking for this condition, leading to a runtime exception. The solution involves adding a check to prevent the division by zero.
